# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-17

### Added

- Slack v0 request signature verification using original body bytes, strict
  signature/timestamp headers and a maximum five-minute timestamp window.
- Signed Slack Events API callback parsing and URL-verification challenge results.
- Durable-queue acceptance example and retry/idempotency guidance.

This release adds the Slack helpers. Cloud support is implemented and released
separately. Publication is performed by GitHub Actions when the matching v0.7.0
tag is pushed; merging the version update alone does not publish the package.

Historical package versions are available on the
[npm versions page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webhook-safe?activeTab=versions).
